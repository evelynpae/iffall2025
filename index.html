        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

       <ol>
          <li> Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc.)
            <p>Evelyn Pae, Communication Design & Art History with a minor in Business of the Arts, Junior<p>
          <li> Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.
            </p> I am currently pursuing a B.F.A in Communication Design, and this class was a requirement as well as an opportunity to learn how to combine my love of designing with actual functional use in the digital space. <p>
          <li> Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.
            <p>I only have one minimal experience with HTML which was using it in my Word and Image studio class for one small excercise.<p>
          <li> Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.
            <p>I hope to learn how to build a website without using templates online. <p>
          <li> Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
            <p>I expect that designing for the screen requires more focus on small details, especially in having to type out each setting which therefore would probably take a little more time than typical designing for paper. Additionally, I imagaine that you have to be much more intentional with user interation with digital work because it requires so much more layers rather than one flat image.<p>
          <li> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
            <p>https://apres-creativestudio.com/
            <p> I feel this website really considers the user's experience, through graphics and moving parts that are very engaging with users, that draw them in and reflects their business having a big focus on creativity. Despite, these cool visual elements, they still make the website very simple to navigate with making sure all the tabs with important information, stay clean and consistent. 
          <li> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice
            <p>https://www.weareinertia.com/
           <p>This website really reflects the core of the business being about motion graphics, through their website that has so much dynamic movement therfore really emphasizing their work's purpose. They also kept their tabs very clean and simple to make it easy to navigate for most users to find their work and contacts. <p>

          <li> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice
            <p>https://www.enotecadellavalpolicella.it/menu 
               <p> This website is great at communicating that it is like a cookbook because from the beginning, it forces users to scroll to "open" up the book to new information and the inside looks like a hand typed book. Additionally the cozy feeling of the recipies is evoked through the cream colored background.
                Additionally, every part of the website is organized neatly such as their wine list through the uniformed spacing. <p>
