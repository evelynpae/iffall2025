    <h3>Why They are Important to Our Ecosystems</h3>
    <p><em>Monarch butterflies migrate up to 3,000 miles each year, using air currents and thermal columns to travel between North America and their wintering grounds in central Mexico.</em></p>

    <h3>How they Travel</h3>
    <p><em>Monarch butterflies travel using a remarkable combination of instinct, environmental cues, and physical adaptations. They rely on air currents and rising warm air called thermals to glide long distances while conserving energy. During their migration, monarchs use the position of the sun and an internal biological clock to stay on course toward their wintering grounds. Their journey can span up to 3,000 miles, making it one of the longest migrations of any insect species in the world. Despite their delicate appearance, monarchs are strong travelers capable of crossing vast landscapes year after year.</em></p>

    <h3>Male Vs. Female</h3>
    <p><em>You can tell the difference between male and female monarch butterflies by looking closely at their wings and body markings. Male monarchs have a distinct black spot, called a scent gland, on each hindwing that females do not have. Their black wing veins are also thinner and less pronounced than those of females. Female monarchs, by contrast, have thicker, darker wing veins and lack the scent glands entirely. Observing these differences makes it easy to distinguish the sexes once you know what to look for.</em></p>
