    <p>Butterfly conservation plays a vital role in preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems. Butterflies are not only beautiful pollinators but also important indicators of environmental health, as they respond quickly to changes in habitat quality and climate. Unfortunately, many butterfly populations worldwide are declining due to habitat destruction, pesticide use, climate change, and invasive species. Protecting butterfly habitats—such as meadows, forests, and wetlands—is essential to ensure their survival. Conservation efforts often focus on restoring native plant species that provide nectar and host plants critical for butterfly reproduction. In addition, creating butterfly-friendly gardens, reducing pesticide use, and supporting protected natural areas help sustain populations. Scientific research and citizen science projects also contribute valuable data for monitoring butterfly trends and informing conservation strategies. By raising awareness and promoting sustainable land management, butterfly conservation not only safeguards these delicate insects but also supports broader environmental health and resilience for generations to come.</p>
